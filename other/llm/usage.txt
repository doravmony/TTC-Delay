revised & polished the following paragraph: This study explores the PATTERNS and REASONS for mining delay situations by analyzing the 2024 TTC subway delay record data, focusing primarily on the existence of CASES of actual delay (i.e., DELAY MINUTES greater than 0). In the EDA part, we found that although most of the delays are brief, WHICH ARE WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE, there are still rare or exceptional events of major service disruptions to the extent that they seriously and massively affect the overall subway operations.What's more, we found that the subway will experience delays more frequently on weekdays than on weekends more, likely due to higher commuter traffic and operational demand at this time.Furthoremore, evidence suggests that longer delays also increase the spacing between trains to a significant degree, resulting in delays to a series of subsequent trips and further reducing service efficiency.

Here is a revised and polished version of the paragraph:
This study examines the patterns and causes of delays in the 2024 TTC subway system, focusing specifically on instances where actual delays occurred (i.e., when delay minutes exceeded zero). Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we observed that while most delays are brief and fall within an acceptable range, there are occasional major disruptions that significantly impact overall subway operations. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that delays are more frequent on weekdays compared to weekends, likely due to higher commuter traffic and increased operational demand during the workweek. Additionally, the data suggests that longer delays can increase the spacing between trains, resulting in a cascade of subsequent delays and further reducing service efficiency.

revised & polished the following paragraph: In the result section, the analysis shows that delays occur more frequently during peak hours of the day, but we have no evidence of longer delays during peak hours, suggesting that while delays may be more frequent, their severity remains similar throughout the day.What's more, the data shows that the number of delays is significantly higher at key transit hubs, attributed to their role as major interchange points in the TTC network and their complex operations. What's more, the data shows significantly higher delays at key transit hubs, attributable to their role as major transfer points on the TTC network, with high traffic volumes and complex operations. The results also show that the most heavily utilized routes tend to experience more frequent delays due to higher ridership and operational loads. furthermore, we found that mechanical failures are a major cause of large-scale delays. This is in contrast to short delays caused by minor problems, and long delays require prioritizing investments and operational improvements, such as focusing on infrastructure upgrades to reduce the incidence of long delays.

Here is a revised and polished version of the paragraph:
In the results section, the analysis indicates that delays occur more frequently during peak hours, though there is no evidence suggesting that these delays are longer in duration compared to non-peak hours. This suggests that while delays are more common during busy periods, their severity remains consistent throughout the day. Additionally, the data reveals a significantly higher number of delays at key transit hubs, likely due to their role as major interchange points in the TTC network, where high traffic volumes and complex operations increase the likelihood of disruptions. The analysis also shows that the most heavily utilized routes experience more frequent delays, driven by higher ridership and operational demands. Moreover, mechanical failures are identified as a leading cause of major delays, in contrast to shorter delays caused by minor issues. Addressing these large-scale disruptions requires prioritizing investments in infrastructure and operational improvements to reduce the frequency and impact of prolonged delays.

revised & polished the following paragraph: our analysis still has all the limitations of focusing on a dataset that only represents a snapshot of TTC operations from January to August 2024, which does not allow us to capture long-term trends in operational efficiency. In the future, we can combine all TTC subway delay data from 2017-2023 available in open data toronto to see if subway delays improve over the long term and around the outbreaks that were the focus of previous studies (around 2019). In particular, based on more comprehensive data, we can further analyze whether large-scale delays due to major special events can be improved based on measures such as upgrading infrastructure. In addition, we analyze whether delays caused by subways are less severe than those caused by buses if there are delays caused by extreme weather conditions, for example, when comparing delays caused by subways and buses. Overall, addressing subway delays can improve the reliability of TTC service. By focusing on infrastructure improvements and better managing rush hour traffic, the TTC can provide a more consistent and satisfying experience for riders.

Our analysis has certain limitations, as it focuses solely on a snapshot of TTC operations from January to August 2024, which may not capture long-term trends in operational efficiency. In the future, we could incorporate the full set of TTC subway delay data from 2017 to 2023, available through Open Data Toronto, to examine whether subway delays have improved over a longer period, particularly around the pre- and post-pandemic periods (before and after 2019). With more comprehensive data, we could also further investigate whether large-scale delays caused by significant events have been mitigated through infrastructure upgrades or other measures. Additionally, a comparison of delays between the subway and bus systems could provide insights, such as whether subway delays are less severe than bus delays during extreme weather conditions.
Overall, addressing subway delays can enhance the reliability of TTC services. By focusing on infrastructure improvements and better management of peak-hour traffic, TTC can provide passengers with a more consistent and satisfactory experience.

polish and revised introduction: While previous studies have identified commuter dissatisfaction and financial stress, there has been no further rigorous analysis of the data to identify specific patterns in delay duration and frequency. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth analysis using the 2024 TTC subway delay dataset, focusing on trends in delays and their causes specific to stations and lines and dates. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, our analysis included which stations and lines had the most delays, which times of day were the most problematic, and which causes led to the longest service interruptions. Our findings show that certain stations and lines are disproportionately affected by delays, and that certain causes, such as mechanical failures, lead to much longer disruptions than others. These findings are critical because they can inform policy changes, resource allocation, and targeted interventions to improve the reliability of TTC service.

Hereâ€™s a revised and polished version of the introduction:
Although previous research has identified commuter dissatisfaction and financial strain related to public transit delays, there has been little rigorous analysis to determine specific patterns in the duration and frequency of these delays. To address this gap, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the 2024 TTC subway delay dataset, focusing on delay trends at the station and line level, as well as across different dates. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, our study examines which stations and lines experience the most delays, the times of day when issues are most severe, and the primary causes behind the longest service disruptions. Our findings reveal that certain stations and lines are disproportionately affected by delays, and that disruptions caused by mechanical failures tend to last significantly longer than those caused by other factors. These insights are crucial as they provide a foundation for policy changes, resource allocation, and targeted interventions to improve the reliability of TTC services.

polish and revised: in real world, subway delay is due to a variety of operational or external factors such as mechanical problems, weather, and accidents. Each time a delay event occurs, the TTC records detailed information such as the location, time, and cause of the delay. These recorded events are compiled into the TTC's subway delay dataset, where each entry represents a delay. In the Data section, we trace this process-how real-world delays are recorded, transformed into structured data, and ultimately used in our analysis.
